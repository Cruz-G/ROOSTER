# ROOSTER
Rule-Based Employee Roster Prediction System  This project provides a modular, Python-based solution for automating employee roster generation using historical booking data. The system reads Excel-based rosters, analyzes individual attendance patterns, applies rule-based logic, and outputs predicted schedules for future months.
